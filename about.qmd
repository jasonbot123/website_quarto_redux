About this site

In my third year at the University of Toronto, I am deeply immersed in the fields of statistics and computer science, where I am constantly honing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and programming. This year has been pivotal in shaping my understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of these disciplines. Iâ€™m becoming more adept at solving complex problems using statistical methods and programming languages like Python and R. Alongside my academic pursuits, I continue to enjoy my passions for basketball, guitar, and fitness, which help me maintain a balanced lifestyle. As an international student, I have become more accustomed to the challenges of studying abroad, embracing them as opportunities for growth. With each step, I am moving closer to my goal of becoming a well-rounded data scientist and machine learning expert.
